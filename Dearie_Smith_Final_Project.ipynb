    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "We attempt to address lack of predictive power of the baseline, industry-standard statistics relative to pitching performance year-over-year in Major League Baseball. The primary means of assessing pitcher performance, Earned Run Average, has little correlation with its year-lagged value and thus is not reliable as a forward looking metric. Subsequent attempts to create 'true talent level predictors' (such as FIP, Fielding Independent Pitching) have yielded only marginal improvements in predictive power.  Leveraging the recent release of granular per-pitch and at-bat data by Statcast, we hope to gain further insight into true talent levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using per-pitch data from the 2017 baseball season, we have derived a few predictors that greatly increase the predictive power of pitchers' ERA in the 2018 season.  While we saw a three-fold increase in predictive power from one season to the next, we acknowledge that a great deal of the variance is left unaccounted for.  As such, we present a few of our ideas regarding avenues for continued research."

    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), a team's success is broadly attributable to the strength of its offense, pitching, and fielding. Identifying means to predict true talent levels in each of these three components can therefore generate considerable returns in a team's performance. Hitting talent has long been considered the most easily quantifiable component in baseball, and fielding is the most difficult, leaving pitching as the most analyzed component of baseball performance in the public sphere currently. Pitching is not insignificant - as shown below, in 2018 alone it correlated strongly with team winning percentage with a significant R-squared of 0.767.  Indeed, there somes to be some truth the traditional basesball wisdom that 'pitching wins'."

    "This makes sense - after all, ERA incorporates additional elements outside of the pitcher's direct control, such as the quality of the defense playing behind the pitcher. This problem is well understood in the baseball analytics (sabermetrics) community, and it has led to the creation of statistics that attempt to isolate the pitcher's performance and convert to an ERA-like statistic. One of the most prominent statistics in the public sphere is Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP). It takes the pitcher's strikeouts, walks, and homeruns as inputs to create an ERA that only accounts for plays that are not reliant on the quality of the pitcher's defense. It has long been stated that FIP has more predictive power for a pitcher's true talent level, and while this is likely true to some degree, it turns out that FIP's ability to predict a pitcher's next-year ERA is nearly as limited as ERA, with an R-squared of 0.041."

    "Again, this makes sense - while FIP effectively isolates the pitcher's performance from that of the pitcher's defense, it almost completely ignores variables such as the quality of contact that a pitcher allows (the only component of FIP that touches on this is homeruns allowed). If a pitcher has the ability to consistently generate weak contact but does not strikeout a lot of batters, then it stands to reason that the pitcher's ERA is likely to be better than FIP.  As you can see below, FIP is a strong predictor of ERA within the same season with an R-squared of .577 and a correlation coefficient of 0.75. This is not unexpected as the FIP constant is normalized to ERA every year, yet there is still a great deal of variance that is left unexplained."

    "#### Predictor Variable Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "We thought it was important to analyze predictor variables that aligned to the following categories:\n",
    "1. 'Stuff': The most relevant variables for 'Stuff' align to the pitcher's pitch velocity, the velocity differential across their pitch types, the horizontal and/or vertical movement of their various pitches, and the spin rates of those pitches.\n",
    "2. Batted Ball: The most relevant predictor variables for this category relate to the quality of contact generated by hitters. These include exit velocity of balls put in play and the launch angle of those balls in play. Launch angle is important because a 'peak' angle is one that maximizes expected runs (as defined by FiveThirtyEight in \"The New Science of Hitting\"). 20-40 degrees is considered the optimal zone to generate high-damage line drives. If the launch angle is too low, the batter is likely to ground out, if it is too high the batter is likely to fly out. A pitcher's deceptiveness and inherent talent can have a great effect on this. \n",
    "3. Zone: Pitchers who have high swinging strike percentages that do not result in contact are considered superior. We primarily focused on 2 variables. The first is swinging strike percentage on pitches outside the zone - a pitcher that is able to get batters to swing at balls outside of the strike zone is one that is likely to have more success because it limits the ability of the batter to barrel the ball. The second is in-zone contact percentage - a pitcher that has a low in-zone contact percentage is one that likely has dominant 'stuff' because despite their pitches being in the strike zone, hitters are still unable to catch up.\n",
    "4. 'Traditional' statistics: In the course of our analysis, we considered several variables such as strikeouts, walks, homeruns, and hits on a per-inning basis as these statistics are thought of as good signals of a pitcher's talent level. Despite this 'common wisdom' hypothesis, it turned out that these variables were not significant predictors of a pitcher's next-year ERA.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependent Variable Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial hypothesis was that the most meaningful dependent variable would be ERA+, which normalizes pitcher ERAs across parks and leagues. This is important because each of the 30 MLB ballparks has very different dimensions and weather conditions, which can either suppress runs scored or bolster them. Additionally, the American League is a higher run-scoring environment than the National League, in part due to talent gaps and in part due to roster construction rule differences, primarily the Designated Hitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We achieved meaningful regression results with ERA+ as the dependent variable, however, upon further examination of the regression output, it was clear that there were some oddities in the data. For one, there was a positive relationship between fastball velocity and ERA+. This ran counter to our expectations because we expected that higher fastball velocities should correlate with a lower ERA. We did consider that it is possible that given league-wide multi-year trends in increasing pitcher velocity that this relationship has been somewhat mitigated, but we then noticed another strange positive relationship between O-Swing% (the % of pitches thrown outside the strike zone that the batter swings at) and ERA+. A higher O-Swing% should correlate with a lower ERA because pitches thrown outside the zone are more difficult to hit, and more difficult to hit with authority. Given these two relationships running counter to expectations, we instead chose ERA as the independent variable - doing so resulted in negligible loss in R-squared, improved p-values, and coefficients that aligned to our expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logging Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we identified meaningful relationships between the predictors and dependent variables, we chose to also log both the predictor and independent variables because 1) we were interested in identifying the multiplicative-multiplicative relationship of predictor variables on the dependent variable as opposed to additive-additive, and 2) the variables we selected had widely varied scales (for example, ERA tends to range from 2.5 to 4.5, whereas fastball velocity tends to range from 88 to 98).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterative Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There were multiple variables of interest across each of the categories mentioned above in the 'Predictor Variable Selection' paragraph. We tested over 20 individual predictors in single regression analyses, and multiple combinations of these predictors in multiple regression analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of Best Regression Model\n",

    "Ultimately, four variables were significant predictors: 1) Fastball Velocity, 2) O-Swing%, 3) Z-Contact%, and 4) Strikeouts per 9 innings. After identifying these important variables, we tested multiple combinations with the less meaningful individual predictors to see if we could improve the R-squared and maintain low p-values, but were unable to do so. Ultimately, our best regression was a 3 factor model that used logged fastball velocity, O-Swing%, and logged strikeouts per 9 innings as predictors. The second best model was also of interest, using logged fastball velocity and O-Swing% and Z-Swing% as predictors. We attempted to combine all four predictors in one model, however, this model resulted in multicollinearity so we are more comfortable proceeding with the two models separated. The results for these two models are shown below."

    "We believe our multiple regression model is a very meaningful predictor for a pitcher's next-year ERA. Considering that both prior year FIP (considered the baseline industry standard for predicting pitcher performance) and ERA account for ~4% of the variance around the mean of next-year ERA, we believe that our model is a very useful predictor, accounting for ~15% of the variance around the mean for next-year ERA.\n",
    "\n",
    "While 15% may seem to be a low R-squared in different environments, we believe that the nature of the sport and pitcher performance in general are such that it would be difficult to build a one-year model of factors within a pitcher's control that can out-perform 15% with publically available data. For example, the quality of defense behind the pitcher can grossly inflate the pitcher's ERA regardless of that pitcher's talent level. Additionally, quality of opposition has a large impact on ERA (e.g., a pitcher facing the World Series winning Red Sox between 5 and 10 times per season will likely suffer a degradation in ERA). \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the factors in our model have a 30% R-squared for predicting logged same-season ERA - this shows that they are crucial factors in pitcher performance. This is particularly interesting because same-season ERA predicts ~4% of the variance around the mean for next-season ERA, and we were able to extract elements that amount to predicting 30% of same-season ERA and generate improved prediction of next-season ERA."

First and foremost, this can serve as the foundation for conducting a multi-year longitudinal regression analysis that would help generate even more insights based on a larger dataset. We were able to predict 2018 performance to a reasonable degree based on 2017 data - it would be interesting to see how this analysis holds up in a multi-year time series regression.\n",
